I enjoy creating beautiful, functional, and impactful products. As a full stack web developer, specializing in both Mern and Microsoft stacks, I provide the benefit of a comprehensive knowledge on both front-end and back-end development cycle to build complete, scalable web or app through a continuous process saving time and money.
